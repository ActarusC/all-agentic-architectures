    "# ðŸ“˜ Agentic Architectures 9: Tree-of-Thoughts Planning\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the ninth notebook in our series. Today, we explore a powerful reasoning and planning architecture: **Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT)**. This pattern elevates an agent's problem-solving capabilities from a linear chain of thought to a multi-path exploratory search.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of generating a single, sequential line of reasoning, a ToT agent generates multiple candidate \"thoughts\" or next steps at each stage of a problem. It then evaluates these thoughts, pruning invalid or unpromising branches and expanding the most promising ones. This creates a search tree where the agent can backtrack, explore alternatives, and systematically navigate a complex problem space.\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate this, we'll task our agent with a classic logic puzzle: the **Wolf, Goat, and Cabbage problem**. This puzzle is famous because it requires non-obvious steps (like bringing an item *back*) and has several invalid states that can trap a naive reasoner. We will show how a simple Chain-of-Thought agent might fail, while the ToT agent methodically constructs a valid plan by exploring and evaluating a tree of possibilities."

    "### Definition\n",
    "**Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT)** is an agentic reasoning framework where problem-solving is modeled as a search through a tree. The agent explores multiple reasoning paths (branches) simultaneously. At each step, it generates potential next steps (\"thoughts\"), evaluates their viability, and decides which paths to continue exploring, effectively pruning the search space.\n",
    "\n",
    "### High-level Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Decomposition:** The problem is broken down into a series of steps or thoughts.\n",
    "2.  **Thought Generation:** For the current state of the problem, the agent generates multiple potential next steps or thoughts. This creates branches in the search tree.\n",
    "3.  **State Evaluation:** Each new thought (leading to a new state) is evaluated by a \"critic\" or a validation function. This evaluation can assess:\n",
    "    *   **Validity:** Is this move allowed by the rules of the problem?\n",
    "    *   **Progress:** Does this move get us closer to the solution?\n",
    "    *   **Heuristics:** Is this path likely to succeed?\n",
    "4.  **Pruning & Expansion:** Invalid or unpromising branches are pruned. The agent then proceeds from the most promising active branches, repeating the thought generation process.\n",
    "5.  **Solution:** The process continues until a goal state is reached. The solution is the path of thoughts from the root to the goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use / Applications\n",
    "*   **Logic Puzzles & Math Problems:** Problems with clear rules and goal states that require multi-step, non-linear reasoning (e.g., Sudoku, river crossing puzzles).\n",
    "*   **Complex Planning:** When a task requires a detailed plan where the order of operations matters and constraints must be respected (e.g., planning a complex trip with multiple legs and budget constraints).\n",
    "*   **Creative Writing or Code Generation:** Exploring multiple story branches or implementation strategies before committing to one.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strengths & Weaknesses\n",
    "*   **Strengths:**\n",
    "    *   **Robustness:** Systematically explores the problem space, making it much less likely to get stuck or produce an incorrect answer compared to a single-pass method.\n",
    "    *   **Handles Combinatorial Complexity:** Well-suited for problems where the number of possible sequences is vast.\n",
    "*   **Weaknesses:**\n",
    "    *   **Computationally Heavy:** Requires significantly more LLM calls and state management than a simple Chain-of-Thought prompt, making it slower and more expensive.\n",
    "    *   **Requires a Good Evaluator:** The effectiveness of the search heavily depends on the quality of the state evaluation logic."

    "### Analysis of the Results\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between the two approaches is profound:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Chain-of-Thought (CoT):** This approach relies on the LLM's pre-trained knowledge to recall the solution. For a classic, well-known problem like this, a powerful LLM can often produce the correct answer in one go. However, if it makes a single mistake, it has no mechanism to self-correct. For a novel or more complex problem, the likelihood of failure is much higher. Its correctness is a matter of recall, not verifiable reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT):** This agent *discovered* the solution through systematic, verifiable search. It didn't just recall an answer; it built one. We can see the process in the logs: expanding paths, then pruning ones that hit dead ends or cycles. Even if the LLM guiding the expansion made a suboptimal choice on one branch, the agent could continue exploring other, more promising branches. This method is far more robust and trustworthy because its final solution is guaranteed to be valid according to the rules of the environment we defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ToT agent's success is not based on luck or memorization, but on the soundness of its search algorithm. This makes it a vastly superior approach for tasks that demand high reliability and planning."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we implemented a **Tree-of-Thoughts** agent to solve a classic logic puzzle. We demonstrated that by transforming a problem into a state space and systematically searching through it, an agent can achieve a level of robustness and accuracy that is impossible with simple, single-pass reasoning methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core components of ToTâ€”**thought generation (expansion)**, **state evaluation (pruning)**, and **search**â€”create a powerful framework for tackling complex planning and reasoning tasks. While it comes with a higher computational cost, the trade-off is a significant increase in reliability and problem-solving capability. This architecture is a key step toward building agents that can reason deliberately and find solutions to challenging, multi-step problems."
