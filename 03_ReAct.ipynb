    "# ðŸ“˜ Agentic Architectures 3: ReAct (Reason + Act)\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the third notebook in our series. We will now explore **ReAct**, a pivotal architecture that bridges the gap between simple tool use and complex, multi-step problem-solving. ReAct stands for **Reason + Act**, and its core innovation is the way it enables an agent to dynamically reason about a problem, act on its reasoning, observe the outcome, and then reason again.\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern transforms an agent from a static tool-caller into an adaptive problem-solver. To highlight its power, we will first build a **basic, single-shot tool-using agent** and show its limitations on a complex task. Then, we will build a full ReAct agent and demonstrate how its iterative `think -> act -> observe` loop allows it to succeed where the basic agent fails."

   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "### Definition\n",
    "The **ReAct** architecture is a design pattern where an agent interleaves reasoning steps with actions. Instead of planning all its steps upfront, the agent generates a thought about its immediate next step, takes an action (like calling a tool), observes the result, and then uses that new information to generate its next thought and action. This creates a dynamic and adaptive loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "### High-level Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Receive Goal:** The agent is given a complex task.\n",
    "2.  **Think (Reason):** The agent generates an internal thought, such as: *\"To answer this, I first need to find piece of information X.\"*\n",
    "3.  **Act:** Based on its thought, the agent executes an action, typically calling a tool (e.g., `search_api('X')`).\n",
    "4.  **Observe:** The agent receives the result from the tool.\n",
    "5.  **Repeat:** The agent incorporates the observation into its context and returns to step 2, generating a new thought (e.g., *\"Okay, now that I have X, I need to use it to find Y.\"*). This loop continues until the overall goal is satisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use / Applications\n",
    "*   **Multi-hop Question Answering:** When answering a question requires finding several pieces of information in sequence (e.g., \"Who is the CEO of the company that makes the iPhone?\").\n",
    "*   **Web Navigation & Research:** An agent can search for a starting point, read the results, and then decide on a new search query based on what it learned.\n",
    "*   **Interactive Workflows:** Any task where the environment is dynamic and the full path to a solution cannot be known in advance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strengths & Weaknesses\n",
    "*   **Strengths:**\n",
    "    *   **Adaptive & Dynamic:** Can adjust its plan on the fly based on new information.\n",
    "    *   **Handles Complexity:** Excels at problems that require chaining multiple dependent steps.\n",
    "*   **Weaknesses:**\n",
    "    *   **Higher Latency & Cost:** Involves multiple sequential LLM calls, making it slower and more expensive than single-shot approaches.\n",
    "    *   **Risk of Loops:** A poorly guided agent can get stuck in repetitive, unproductive loops of thought and action."

    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we have not only implemented the **ReAct** architecture but also demonstrated its clear superiority over a more basic, single-shot approach. By building a workflow that allows an agent to loop through a cycle of reasoning and acting, we have enabled it to solve complex, multi-step problems that would otherwise be intractable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ability to observe the outcome of an action and use that information to inform the next step is a fundamental component of intelligent behavior. The ReAct pattern provides a simple yet profoundly effective way to build this capability into our AI agents, making them more powerful, adaptive, and useful for real-world tasks."
