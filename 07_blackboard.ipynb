    "# ðŸ“˜ Agentic Architectures 7: Blackboard Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the seventh notebook in our series on agentic architectures. Today, we explore the **Blackboard System**, a powerful and highly flexible pattern for coordinating multiple specialist agents. This architecture is modeled on the idea of a group of human experts collaborating around a physical blackboard to solve a complex problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of a rigid, predefined sequence of agent handoffs, a Blackboard system features a central, shared data store (the 'blackboard') where agents can read the current state of the problem and write their contributions. A dynamic **Controller** observes the blackboard and decides which specialist agent to activate next based on what is needed to move the solution forward. This allows for an opportunistic and emergent workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "To highlight its unique advantages, we will compare it to the **sequential multi-agent system** we built previously. We will present both systems with a complex financial query where the optimal path isn't a simple A â†’ B â†’ C sequence. We will demonstrate how the rigid sequential agent follows a suboptimal path, while the Blackboard system's dynamic Controller activates agents in a more logical, data-driven order, resulting in a more efficient and coherent analysis."

    "### Definition\n",
    "A **Blackboard System** is a multi-agent architecture where multiple specialist agents collaborate by reading from and writing to a shared, central data repository called the 'blackboard'. A controller or scheduler dynamically determines which agent should act next based on the evolving state of the solution on the blackboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "### High-level Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Shared Memory (The Blackboard):** A central data structure holds the current state of the problem, including the user's request, intermediate findings, and partial solutions.\n",
    "2.  **Specialist Agents:** A pool of independent agents, each with a specific expertise, continuously monitors the blackboard.\n",
    "3.  **Controller:** A central 'controller' agent also monitors the blackboard. Its job is to analyze the current state and decide which specialist agent is best equipped to make the next contribution.\n",
    "4.  **Opportunistic Activation:** The Controller activates the chosen agent. The agent reads the relevant data from the blackboard, performs its task, and writes its findings back to the blackboard.\n",
    "5.  **Iteration:** The process repeats, with the Controller activating different agents in a dynamic sequence, until it determines that the solution on the blackboard is complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use / Applications\n",
    "*   **Complex, Ill-Structured Problems:** Ideal for problems where the solution path is not known in advance and requires an emergent, opportunistic strategy (e.g., complex diagnostics, scientific discovery).\n",
    "*   **Multi-Modal Systems:** A great way to coordinate agents that work with different data types (text, images, code), as they can all post their findings to the shared blackboard.\n",
    "*   **Dynamic Sense-Making:** Situations that require synthesizing information from many disparate, asynchronous sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strengths & Weaknesses\n",
    "*   **Strengths:**\n",
    "    *   **Flexibility & Adaptability:** The workflow is not hardcoded; it emerges based on the problem, making the system highly adaptive.\n",
    "    *   **Modularity:** It's very easy to add or remove specialist agents without re-architecting the entire system.\n",
    "*   **Weaknesses:**\n",
    "    *   **Controller Complexity:** The intelligence of the entire system depends heavily on the sophistication of the Controller. A naive Controller can lead to inefficient or looping behavior.\n",
    "    *   **Debugging Challenges:** The non-linear, emergent nature of the workflow can sometimes make it harder to trace and debug than a simple sequential process."

    "The judge's scores provide a clear, quantitative verdict:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **Sequential Agent** will receive a very low `instruction_following_score` (e.g., 2/10) because it blatantly ignored the \"either/or\" condition. Its `process_efficiency_score` will also be low (e.g., 3/10) because it performed an entire analysis that was explicitly not required.\n",
    "- The **Blackboard System** will receive near-perfect scores (e.g., 10/10) for both. The judge will recognize that the Controller's dynamic decision-making allowed the system to follow the user's instructions precisely and to operate with maximum efficiency by only activating the necessary specialist.\n",

    "In this notebook, we have implemented and corrected a **Blackboard System**, demonstrating its significant advantages over a sequential multi-agent architecture. By introducing a shared memory (the blackboard) and an intelligent, state-aware **Controller**, we created a system that is not just collaborative, but also adaptive and opportunistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "The head-to-head comparison showed that for tasks with conditional logic, the Blackboard system's ability to choose the right expert at the right time leads to a more efficient and logically sound process. While it requires a more sophisticated Controller, this architecture is a powerful tool for tackling the kind of ill-structured, real-world problems that rigid, linear workflows cannot solve effectively."
