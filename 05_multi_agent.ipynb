    "# ðŸ“˜ Agentic Architectures 5: Multi-Agent Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we advance to one of the most powerful and flexible architectures: the **Multi-Agent System**. This pattern moves beyond the concept of a single agent, no matter how complex, and instead models a team of specialized agents that collaborate to solve a problem. Each agent has a distinct role, persona, and set of skills, mirroring how human expert teams work.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach allows for a profound 'division of labor', where complex problems are broken down into sub-tasks and assigned to the agent best suited for the job. To showcase its power, we will conduct a direct comparison. First, we'll task a single **monolithic 'generalist' agent** with creating a comprehensive market analysis report. Then, we will assemble a **specialist team**â€”a Technical Analyst, a News Analyst, and a Financial Analystâ€”and have a fourth 'Manager' agent synthesize their expert inputs into a final report. The difference in quality, structure, and depth will be immediately apparent."

    "### Definition\n",
    "A **Multi-Agent System** is an architecture where a group of distinct, specialized agents collaborate (or sometimes compete) to achieve a common goal. A central controller or a defined workflow protocol is used to manage communication and route tasks between the agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "### High-level Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Decomposition:** A main controller or the user provides a complex task.\n",
    "2.  **Role Definition:** The system assigns sub-tasks to specialized agents based on their defined roles (e.g., 'Researcher', 'Coder', 'Critic', 'Writer').\n",
    "3.  **Collaboration:** Agents execute their tasks, often in parallel or sequence. They pass their outputs to each other or to a central 'blackboard'.\n",
    "4.  **Synthesis:** A final 'manager' or 'synthesizer' agent collects the outputs from the specialist agents and assembles the final, consolidated response.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use / Applications\n",
    "*   **Complex Report Generation:** Creating detailed reports that require expertise from multiple domains (e.g., financial analysis, scientific research).\n",
    "*   **Software Development Pipelines:** Simulating a dev team with a programmer, a code reviewer, a tester, and a project manager.\n",
    "*   **Creative Brainstorming:** A team of agents with different 'personalities' (e.g., one optimistic, one cautious, one wildly creative) can generate a more diverse set of ideas.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strengths & Weaknesses\n",
    "*   **Strengths:**\n",
    "    *   **Specialization & Depth:** Each agent can be fine-tuned with a specific persona and tools, leading to higher-quality work in its domain.\n",
    "    *   **Modularity & Scalability:** It's easy to add, remove, or upgrade individual agents without redesigning the entire system.\n",
    "    *   **Parallelism:** Multiple agents can work on their sub-tasks simultaneously, potentially reducing overall task time.\n",
    "*   **Weaknesses:**\n",
    "    *   **Coordination Overhead:** Managing the communication and workflow between agents adds complexity to the system design.\n",
    "    *   **Increased Cost & Latency:** Running multiple agents involves more LLM calls, which can be more expensive and slower than a single-agent approach."

The **Multi-Agent Team's** report will receive significantly higher scores, especially in `clarity_and_structure_score` and `analytical_depth_score`. The justification from the judge will likely praise the clear sectioning and the detailed, expert-level analysis within each part, which stands in contrast to the more generic and jumbled output from the monolithic agent.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we have demonstrated the clear advantages of a **Multi-Agent System** over a single, monolithic agent for complex, multi-faceted tasks. By creating a team of specialized agents, each with a focused persona and role, and a manager to synthesize their work, we produced a final output of demonstrably higher quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key takeaway is the power of **specialization**. Just as in human organizations, breaking down a large problem and assigning its parts to experts yields better results. While this architecture introduces more complexity in orchestration, the significant improvement in the structure, depth, and professionalism of the final output makes it an indispensable pattern for any serious agentic application that needs to deliver expert-level performance across multiple domains."
