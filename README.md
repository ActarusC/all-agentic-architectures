Welcome to a comprehensive, hands-on masterclass in **modern AI agent design**. This repository contains detailed implementations of **17+ state-of-the-art agentic architectures**, built with LangChain and LangGraph. It is designed to be a living textbook, bridging the gap between theoretical concepts and practical, production-ready code.

## üìñ Why This Repository?

The field of AI agents is evolving at an incredible pace, but many resources remain abstract and theoretical. This project was created to provide a structured, practical, and deeply educational path for developers, researchers, and AI enthusiasts to master the art of building intelligent systems.

-   **From Theory to Tangible Code:** Each architecture is not just explained but implemented end-to-end in a runnable Jupyter notebook.
-   **Structured Learning Path:** The notebooks are ordered to build concepts progressively, from foundational patterns to highly advanced, multi-agent and self-aware systems.
-   **Emphasis on Evaluation:** We don't just build agents, we measure them. Most notebooks feature a robust `LLM-as-a-Judge` pattern to provide quantitative, objective feedback on an agent's performance, a critical skill for production AI.
-   **Real-World Scenarios:** The examples are grounded in practical applications‚Äîfinancial analysis, coding, social media management, medical triage‚Äîmaking the concepts immediately relevant.
-   **Consistent, Modern Framework:** By using `LangGraph` as the core orchestrator, you will learn a powerful, stateful, and cyclical approach to agent design that is rapidly becoming the industry standard.

## üó∫Ô∏è A Guided Tour Through the Architectures

The repository is structured to take you on a journey from simple enhancements to building truly sophisticated, multi-agent, self-aware systems.

<summary><b>Click to expand the learning path</b></summary>

#### Part 1: Foundational Patterns (Notebooks 1-4)
This section covers the essential building blocks for making a single agent more powerful.
- We start with **Reflection** to improve output quality.
- Then, we give the agent **Tools** to interact with the world.
- **ReAct** combines these into a dynamic loop.
- Finally, **Planning** adds foresight and structure to its actions.

#### Part 2: Multi-Agent Collaboration (Notebooks 5, 7, 11, 13)
Here, we explore how to make agents work together.
- **Multi-Agent Systems** introduces the concept of specialized teams.
- The **Meta-Controller** acts as a smart router to dispatch tasks to these teams.
- The **Blackboard** provides a flexible, shared workspace for dynamic collaboration.
- The **Ensemble** pattern uses multiple agents in parallel for more robust, diverse analysis.

#### Part 3: Advanced Memory & Reasoning (Notebooks 8, 9, 12)
This section focuses on how agents can think more deeply and remember what they've learned.
- **Episodic + Semantic Memory** provides a powerful, human-like memory system.
- The **Graph World-Model** allows for complex reasoning over interconnected knowledge.
- **Tree of Thoughts** enables systematic, multi-path exploration to solve hard logic problems.

#### Part 4: Safety, Reliability, and Real-World Interaction (Notebooks 6, 10, 14, 17)
These architectures are critical for building agents that can be trusted in production.
- The **Dry-Run Harness** provides a crucial human-in-the-loop safety layer.
- The **Simulator** allows an agent to "think before it acts" by modeling consequences.
- **PEV** builds in automatic error detection and recovery.
- The **Metacognitive** agent understands its own limitations, a key to safe operation in high-stakes domains.

#### Part 5: Learning and Adaptation (Notebooks 15, 16)
The final section explores how agents can improve over time and solve problems in novel ways.
- The **Self-Improvement Loop** creates a mechanism for an agent to learn from feedback, analogous to RLHF.
- **Cellular Automata** showcases how complex global behavior can emerge from simple, local rules, creating highly adaptive systems.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up your local environment and run the notebooks.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/all-agentic-architectures.git
cd all-agentic-architectures
```

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment

It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

```bash
# For Unix/macOS
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# For Windows
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install all the required Python packages from the `requirements.txt` file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To visualize graphs in LangGraph, you may also need to install `pygraphviz`.

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

The agents require API keys to function. Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project directory. You can copy the provided `requirements.txt` content to see what's needed and then create your `.env` file.

Open the `.env` file and add your credentials. It should look like this:

```python
# .env file

# Nebius AI API Key (for LLM access)
NEBIUS_API_KEY="your_nebius_api_key_here"

# LangSmith API Key (for tracing and debugging)
LANGCHAIN_API_KEY="your_langsmith_api_key_here"
LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2="true"
LANGCHAIN_PROJECT="All-Agentic-Architectures" # Optional: Set a project name

# Tavily Search API Key (for the Research agent's tool)
TAVILY_API_KEY="your_tavily_api_key_here"

# Neo4j Credentials (for Graph and Memory architectures)
# You must have a Neo4j instance running (e.g., via Docker or Neo4j Desktop)
NEO4J_URI="bolt://localhost:7687"
NEO4J_USERNAME="neo4j"
NEO4J_PASSWORD="your_neo4j_password_here"
```

### 5. Run the Notebooks

You can now launch Jupyter and explore the notebooks in numerical order.

```bash
jupyter notebook
```
