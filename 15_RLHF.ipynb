    "# 📘 Agentic Architectures 15: Self-Improvement Loop (Self-Refine & RLHF Analogy)\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to a deep dive into what is arguably the most advanced agentic pattern: the **Self-Improvement Loop**. This architecture enables an agent to learn from its own performance, iteratively refining its output to achieve a higher standard of quality. It's the mechanism that allows an agent to go from a good baseline to expert-level performance over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process mimics the human learning cycle of `do -> get feedback -> improve`. We will implement this through a **Self-Refine** workflow, where an agent's output is immediately evaluated by a critical sub-agent, and if it's found lacking, the original agent is tasked with revising its work based on the actionable feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make this concept tangible and detailed, we will build a **Marketing Copywriter Agent**. The workflow will be:\n",
    "1.  A `JuniorCopywriter` agent generates a first draft of a marketing email.\n",
    "2.  A `SeniorEditor` agent critiques the draft against a strict rubric (clarity, persuasiveness, call-to-action).\n",
    "3.  If the draft's score is below a quality threshold, the `JuniorCopywriter` is invoked again, but this time with the editor's specific feedback, to create a revised draft.\n",
    "4.  This loop continues until the email is approved or a maximum number of revisions is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, we will explore how this pattern forms the conceptual basis for **long-term learning**, analogous to RLHF, by saving the best-performing outputs to a persistent memory that informs future generations, creating a system that truly learns."

    "### Definition\n",
    "A **Self-Improvement Loop** is an agentic architecture where an agent's output is evaluated, either by itself or by another agent, and this evaluation is used as feedback to generate a revised, higher-quality output. When this feedback is stored and used to improve the agent's baseline performance over time, it becomes a form of continual learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### High-level Workflow (Self-Refine)\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Generate Initial Output:** The primary agent produces a first version of the solution (the \"draft\").\n",
    "2.  **Critique Output:** A critic agent (or the primary agent in a \"critique mode\") evaluates the draft against a set of predefined criteria or a general rubric.\n",
    "3.  **Decision:** The system checks if the critique is positive enough to accept the output. \n",
    "4.  **Revise (Loop):** If the output is not accepted, the original draft *and* the critic's feedback are passed back to the primary agent, which is instructed to generate a revised version that addresses the feedback.\n",
    "5.  **Accept:** Once the output meets the quality standard, the loop terminates, and the final version is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use / Applications\n",
    "*   **High-Quality Content Generation:** For tasks where a generic first draft is insufficient, such as writing legal documents, detailed technical reports, or persuasive marketing copy.\n",
    "*   **Continual Learning & Personalization:** An agent that learns a user's preferences by generating responses, getting implicit or explicit feedback, and refining its internal strategy for the next interaction.\n",
    "*   **Complex Problem Solving:** An agent can propose a plan, critique it for flaws or inefficiencies, and then revise the plan before execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strengths & Weaknesses\n",
    "*   **Strengths:**\n",
    "    *   **Dramatically Increases Output Quality:** Iterative refinement consistently produces better results than single-shot generation.\n",
    "    *   **Enables Continual Learning:** Provides a framework for the agent to get better over time, adapting to new information or feedback.\n",
    "*   **Weaknesses:**\n",
    "    *   **Risk of Reinforcing Biases:** If the critic agent has flawed logic or biases, the system can get stuck in a loop that reinforces its own mistakes.\n",
    "    *   **Computationally Expensive:** The iterative nature means multiple LLM calls per task, increasing cost and latency."

    "### Analysis of the Results\n",
    "\n",
    "This detailed implementation reveals a two-layered improvement process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Intra-Task Improvement (Self-Refine):** During the first run, the agent's initial draft was deliberately mediocre (score: 4/10). The logs clearly show the specific, actionable feedback from the Senior Editor. The agent then produced a revised draft that was a dramatic improvement, earning a 9/10 and getting approved. This shows the immediate benefit of the loop for improving a single output.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Inter-Task Improvement (Persistent Learning):** In the second demonstration, the agent was given a *new* task. However, its generator was now armed with a high-quality example from the previous successful run. The output log is the proof of learning: the agent's **first draft for the new product was so good that it scored a 9/10 immediately**, requiring no revisions. This is a powerful demonstration of learning. The agent's baseline performance has improved because it learned from its past, editor-approved successes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This second part is a direct, practical analogy for RLHF. We are reinforcing the agent's behavior by showing it examples of what \"good\" looks like, thereby improving its ability to generate high-quality outputs from the very first attempt on future tasks."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we have implemented a comprehensive and complex **Self-Improvement Loop**. We have demonstrated that this architecture is not just about refining a single piece of work, but is a powerful paradigm for creating agents that genuinely learn and improve over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "By separating the roles of **generator** and **critic**, we create a dynamic of feedback and revision that consistently elevates the quality of the agent's output. By adding a **persistent memory** for high-quality results, we create a positive feedback loop that improves the agent's baseline capabilities, making it more efficient and effective on future tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the risk of the critic reinforcing its own biases is real and requires careful management, the potential to build agents that learn from experience is a transformative step towards more autonomous, capable, and intelligent AI systems."
